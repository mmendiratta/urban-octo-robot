# X-Team NN Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks



## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
* The first thing would to be make sure that everyone understands their specific task to complete out of however many are needed for the project. 
* The second thing is to have progress updates once a week (Sundays) and make sure that everyone is still on the same page, and if a member needs help then it is supplied. 
* The third thing is to make sure that everything is assigned and completed before the deadline.
## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
* Initially first write out the task on a paper and make sure everyone understand what the task is asking for. 
* Second, we will put up any possible solution we can come out with and share ideas.
* Distrubutes the work and update when there is progress.
