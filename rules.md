# X-Team 47 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks



## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks



## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us



## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
1) If one team member is falling behind, others will encourage them and help pick up slack.
2) In order to ensure that deadlines are not forgotten or missed, a shared calendar will be kept.
3) Team members that appear to be falling behind based on work done (or lack of) will be contacted proactively to ensure that all is being done to create an environment in which effective productivity can happen.
4) Notifications will be sent to teammates on the day of and days preceding due dates.
