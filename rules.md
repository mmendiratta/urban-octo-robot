# X-Team 47 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
* We will evaluate the tasks assigned by the instructor and categorize them based on difficulty (time committment) and deadline. 
* We will then categorize the tasks as _group_ or as _individual_, based on the percieved time committment and difficulty, and assign as such
* Then, we will either break off or get together to complete the tasks. 
* Once the deadline of task completion approaches, we will evaluate the tasks and see whether or not we need to colloborate on the tasks or reassign to a team member that understands the task better. 


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks



## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
* Initially first write out the task on a paper and make sure everyone understand what the task is asking for. 
* Second, we will put up any possible solution we can come out with and share ideas.
* Distrubutes the work and update when there is progress.

## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
* If one team member is falling behind, others will encourage them and help pick up slack.
* In order to ensure that deadlines are not forgotten or missed, a shared calendar will be kept.
* Team members that appear to be falling behind based on work done (or lack of) will be contacted proactively to ensure that all is being done to create an environment in which effective productivity can happen.
* Notifications will be sent to teammates on the day of and days preceding due dates. 

## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
* Establish team goals;
* Establish more listening and brainstorming;
* Be clear when communicating;
* Finish the assigned task on time;
